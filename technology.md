# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL through PGAdmin is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate SQLAlchemy to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is Logistical Regression. We will also incorportate Random Forest to make predictions using our testing data. We we also use train_test_split model to generate the datasets. 

## Dashboard
In addition to using a SQLAlchemy, we will also integrate Taabluea for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be displayed overall through a story.
