# Disease_Prediction
Data Analysis Final Project

##Code Blue Team Members
* Frank Sullivan
* Jade Bible
* John Setzer
* Morgan Behr 
* Summer Bell


### Roles for project:
Our team will transition roles during the different segments of the project. We have five group members so we will have multiple people within one role.

Square: The Team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository. John will be the team member responsible for the GitHub repository. He created our repository and is handling merging branches.

Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. Frank created a diagram that shows how Code Blue's maching learning model will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.

Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. Jade created a mockup database that will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.

X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project. Morgan documented the technologies that all team members agreed to.

## Topic Selected: Disease Prediction using Machine Learning. This topic uses data that has 132 parameters to help predict 42 different types of diseases. 

## Reason Why The Topic Was Selected: The dataset provided is in a testing and training file, so this will give us to chance to show the skills we learned from Modules 17, 18, and 19 including logistical regression, K-means, hierarchical clustering, Tensorflow and Random Forest.
## Description of their Source of Data: The data we used is from Kaggle. It is two csv files. The source of the data from the author is not disclosed. 
The training file is [Training.csv](Resources/Training.csv) and the testing file is [Testing.csv](Resources/Testing.csv)

## Questions with the data we hope to answer:

Can our model use the training file to predict the percentage chance of the diseases showing in the future based on the symptoms?

Identify diseases with similar symptoms and how that could impact the accuracy of the prognosis?
