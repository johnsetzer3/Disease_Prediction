# Data Analysis Final Project: Disease_Prediction

## Code Blue Team Members
* Frank Sullivan
* Jade Bible
* John Setzer
* Morgan Behr 
* Summer Bell


### Roles for project:
Our team will transition roles during the different segments of the project. We have five group members so we will have multiple people within one role.

Square: The square role focuses on the machine learning model. 
John 

Triangle: The member in the triangle role will upscale the project's databse. 
Our data sets were uploaded and into PgAdmin as two tables where they were joined with SQL.
The static database will be used throughout the project and maintained by Morgan. 

Circle: The member in the circle role will continue to refine the anlysis.
Summer / Frank

X: The member in the X role work on the team's dashboard
Jade is creating our story board in Tableau.
This presentation will clearly represent our data with 3 images.


## Topic Selected: Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 
This topic uses data that has 132 parameters to help predict 42 different types of diseases. 

## Reason Why the Topic Was Selected: 
The dataset provided is in a testing and training file.
Machine learning utilizes both training and testing data.
This data is optimal for a linear regression model.


## Description of the Source of Data: 
The data we used is two csv file downloaded from Kaggle. 
The training file is [Training.csv](Resources/Training.csv) and the testing file is [Testing.csv](Resources/Testing.csv).
The source of the data from the author is not disclosed.

## Description of the Data Exploration Phase of the Project:
A key part of the data exploration phase is preprocessing the data.
This allows us to learn about the data characteristics and identify potential problems.

## Description of the Analysis Phase of the Project:
The data types in our data set was evaluated.
For the model to function correctly all data in both data sets has to be in the correct data type: float64 and int64.
In addition all columns with null data were removed with the drop code in Python.


## Questions We Hope to Answer With the Data:
 * Can our machine learning model be used to predict the correct disease based on symptoms entered?
 * How many symptoms need to be present to increase the accuracy of the model?
 
* Can our model use the training file to predict the percentage chance of the diseases showing in the future based on the symptoms?
