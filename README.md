# Disease_Prediction
Data Analysis Final Project

## Group Members
* Frank Sullivan
* Jade Bible
* John Setzer
* Morgan Behr 
* Summer Bell


### Roles for project:
(Please choose your desired role, we do have five members, so we will transition through each role during each segment of the project. We also have five group members, so we could group up with two people on one role.)

Square: The Team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository (John will be the team member responsible for the repository. He created our repository initially).

Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.

Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.

X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project (Morgan, Summer, Frank and John)

## Topic Selected: Disease Prediction using Machine Learning. This topic uses data that has 132 parameters to help predict 42 different types of diseases. 

## Reason Why The Topic Was Selected: The dataset provided is in a testing and training file, so this will give us to chance to show the skills we learned from Modules 17, 18, and 19 including logistical regression, K-means, hierarchical clustering, Tensorflow and Random Forest.
## Description of their Source of Data: The data we used is from Kaggle. It is two csv files. The source of the data from the author is not disclosed. 

## Questions with the data we hope to answer:

Can our model use the training file to predict the percentage chance of the diseases showing in the future based on the symptoms?

What is the most common disease based on the training file?

Is there any way to train the disease to specify gender or age of the patient?

Identify diseases with similar symptoms and how that could impact the accuracy of the prognosis?

## (Please feel free to add any questions you wish after reviewing the data)
